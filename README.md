# Book Catalog with Search and Bookmarks

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

** Note: Data is saved in local storage\
** Logo from www.catalog.style

This code is fixed for deploying with GitHub Pages
Have to use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter, refer to [GitHub Pages incapibility] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75967389/react-router-dom-wont-work-when-i-deploy-with-gh-pages).
The use of HashRouter cause effects to path checking and href/ redirecting to another page

** For code with BrowserRouter can be checked on main branch
